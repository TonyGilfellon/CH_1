The CHANG-ES_Pipeline_1.py program is the first step in the analysis of the CHANG-ES dataset to link a galaxy's integrated polarisation position angle, PPA, to its intrinsic position angle, IPA.

The .FITS files can be downloaded from the CHANG-ES website (available at: https://www.queensu.ca/changes/). In this analysis pipeline I used the D-configuration C-band 'Rob 0 (PBcor)' for the total intensity and linear polarisation maps and the 'Rob 0' for the polarisation angle map.

The data that is read in on line 145 is the CHANG-ES_pipeline_1_data.txt file in the repository.

The data analysis products for NGC3628 are included in the repository as examples.

Some of the functions were written in conjuction with Lee Whittaker based on work carried out by Richard Battye & Lee Whittaker.
